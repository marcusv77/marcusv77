### console.log("About me");
Hello everybody, my name is **`Marcus Fernandes`** and this is my github. I'm an intern in Software Engineering at [SYDLE](https://www.sydle.com/) and I'm currently studying Computer Science at the [Federal University of Ouro Preto](https://ufop.br/), where I participate in the scientific initiation project ([CRIC](https://database.cric.com.br/)) with the theme "Digital image processing applied to the evaluation of cells in Pap smears", it's a basis for publicly storing data of cell images cervical cancer in order to support the analysis of cervical cancer in the Pap smear.

In addition to being an undergraduate, intern and research student, I also dedicate my time to the financial market (buy & hold) and the development of web and mobile applications, working on a full stack for projects with a wide range of themes.
